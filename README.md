# jaccard

For this assignment you will compare the similarity between two texts. Is Dracula of Bram Stoker, more similar to the work of Shakespeare or to the script of La La Land?

We provide you with some code that can compute the similarities between texts, based on [the Jaccard index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index). The problem is, this code is not very efficient. Your goal is to improve it.
